**xdatbus** is a Python library specifically tailored for VASP users engaged in research on ab-initio MD simulations, as well as biased MD simulations. The primary file addressed by the package is the XDATCAR, a trajectories file generated by the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). The package documentation can be accessed [here](https://xdatbus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the Jupyter Notebook [tutorial](https://github.com/jcwang587/xdatbus/tree/main/examples) is also available.


## Installation

Make sure you have a Python interpreter, preferably version 3.10 or higher:

```bash
❯ python --version
Python 3.11.4
```

Then, you can simply install `xdatbus` from pypi using `pip`:

```bash
❯ pip install xdatbus
```


## Get Started

This is quick example of how to test a Random Forest classifier on the Animals dataset:

```python
import os
from xdatbus import f01_aggregate

aimd_path = "./data"
output_path = os.path.dirname(aimd_path)

f01_aggregate(aimd_path=aimd_path, output_path=main_tmp_dir)
```

## Update log
`0.0.6` first upload for test
