Installation
=====

.. _installation:

1. Installing with pip
----------------

Make sure you have a Python interpreter, preferably version 3.10 or higher:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python --version
   Python 3.11.4


To use `xdatbus`, install it from the PyPI repository using `pip`, which will also ensure that all requirements are obtained in the meantime:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install xdatbus

To get the latest version of `xdatbus`, if you have it already installed, please run the command with the `upgrade` option:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install --upgrade xdatbus

If you'd like to use the latest unreleased version on the main branch, you can install it directly from `GitHub <https://github.com/jcwang587/xdatbus>`_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install -U git+https://https://github.com/jcwang587/xdatbus


2. Installing with conda
----------------

.. note::

   Conda installation will be made available with an option to install `xdatbus` bundled with `plumed2` in the coming version.
