Installation

.. _installation:

Installing with pip
----------------

Make sure you have a Python interpreter, preferably version 3.10 or higher:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ python --version
   Python 3.11.4


To use `xdatbus`, install it from the PyPI repository using `pip`, which will also ensure that all requirements are obtained in the meantime:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install xdatbus

To get the latest version of `xdatbus`, if you have it already installed, please run the command with the `--upgrade` option:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install --upgrade xdatbus

Installing with Conda
----------------

.. note::

   Conda installation will be made available with an option to install xdatbus bundled with plumed2 in the coming version.
