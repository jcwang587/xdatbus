xdatbus's documentation
===================================

**xdatbus** is a Python library designed for VASP users who conduct research on ab-initio MD simulations, as well as biased MD simulations. The main file that the package addresses is the `XDATCAR <https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/XDATCAR/>`_, which is the trajectories file generated by the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (`VASP <https://www.vasp.at/>`_).


Check out the :doc:`installation` section to get started, and :doc:`usage` section for analyzing your AIMD simulations.
